# House Price Regression Analysis

## Date

October 2021

## Project Description

Implemented and compared several regression models, including KNN regression, linear regression, and polynomial regression models, to predict future house prices using normalized and unnormalized features.

Created effective data visualizations to illustrate the impact of various parameters on the regression models.

Conducted 10,000 iterations of gradient descent to obtain an optimized weight matrix for the polynomial regression models and minimize the square error cost function.

Split the data into training and validation sets to perform K-folds cross validation techniques to derive an optimal model for deployment on the test data set.
